It is subset of a CAL FIRE dataset with historical boundaries for fires (including both natural and prescribed fires) in the state of California. The dataset has a good record of past large fires but is not complete and may be missing some fires. The thomas_fire.shp data is stored in /data/thomas_fire folder in the repo, I did not push the original full Cal Fire dataset to GitHub, it was accessed locally.\nThe landsat.nc dataset is an image from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2, from the Microsof Planetary Computer data catalogue.

Explore the Data\nNow I’m interested in learning more about the landsat data that I’ll be using.

It’s CRS is is EPSG 32611 or WGS 84 / UTM Zone 11N. The Landsat data has a total of 1 band. Its size is 870 by 731. I also got its original coordinates and a list of the variables in the dataset which are ‘red’, ‘green’, ‘blue’, ‘nir08’, and ‘swir22’. Since there is only one band for the data, I’m going to simplify it by dropping the dimensions to make it easier to work with.\n\n\nStep 1D. Prepare the landsat data for visualization\nSince the landsat data only has one band, I can simplify it so that it’s easier to work with. To do this, I’m going to use .squeeze() and .drop_vars() to remove the band length of 1.\n\n# Remove length 1 dimension (band) and reassign\nlandsat = landsat.squeeze().drop_vars('band', errors='ignore')\n\n# Check updated dimensions of the coordinates\nprint(landsat.dims, landsat.coords)\n\nFrozenMappingWarningOnValuesAccess({'x': 870, 'y': 731}) Coordinates:\n  * x            (x) float64 7kB 1.213e+05 1.216e+05 ... 3.557e+05 3.559e+05\n  * y            (y) float64 6kB 3.952e+06 3.952e+06 ... 3.756e+06 3.755e+06\n    spatial_ref  int64 8B 0\n\n\n\n\nStep 1E. Visualize the Landsat data in true color\n‘True-color’ is a term used by remote sensing experts to describe displaying a satellite image in colors similar to what most people would see with their bare eyes. This means plotting the ‘red’, ‘green’, and ‘blue’ bands in their respective order.\nHere I plot the landsat image in true color (R-G-B) to visualize what the burn area looks like over the region.\n\n# Select and plot the red, green, and blue variables\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\n\nClipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmmmm…. something here doesn’t look right! The map shows up in black and white when I was expecting it to look like a true color image.\nThis is because the clouds in the image introduce extreme, outlier values. By setting the robust = True parameter in the in .imshow(), I adjust the color scale based on the 2nd and 98th percentiles of the values, which helps minimize the influence of these outliers. This allows the color ramp to more accurately reflect the distribution of values where most of the data lies, providing a clearer representation of the underlying “true color” patterns in the image.\n\n# Select and plot the red, green, and blue variables\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True) # scale on the 2 & 98th percentiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhhh, much better! Now this is more like what I was expecting to see in my true color image. This map helps me get a feel for what the landscape looks like, but it is difficult for me to distinguish between landcover like healthy, dense vegetation versus bare grounding.\n\n\nStep 1F. Visualize the Landsat data in false\nNext, I’d like to see if I can visualize the burned area better by integrating other bands of the landsat image in ‘false color’. ‘False color’ is a term in remote sensing to describe when colors are assigned to represent data that isn’t visible to the human eye, for example using different wavelengths of light like near-infrared.\nVegetation is known to be highly reflective in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands and absorbs in the red, so by visualizing the surface with this it helps pick out healthy, productive vegetated areas from bare ground. For this reason, I want to visualize the landsat image in “false color” using the SWIR, NIR, and red bands (SWIR-NIR-R).\n\n# Select and plot swir, nir, and red variables\nfalse_color = landsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True) # scale on the 2 & 98th percentiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat worked! Now I can much more easily distinguish between different land surface characteristics. I can see a large and irregular area in red, which roughly delineates bare ground, in the area where the Thomas Fire burned.\n\n### Step 1G.
