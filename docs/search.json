    "text": "Using Satellite & Air Quality Data\nAuthor: Nicole Pepper\nDate: 12/04/2024\nThe Thomas Fire, which ignited on December 4, 2017, burned approximately 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, making it one of the largest and most devastating wildfires in California’s history. The fire left behind extensive burn scars with widespread loss of vegetation and unstable soil, leaving the region vulnerable to erosion. In 2018, heavy rains caused massive flooding and debris flows, which resulted in catastrophic damage and tragic loss of life.\nHere I share my beginner’s Python exercise exploring some of the impacts of the Thomas Fire using satellite imagery and air quality data."
