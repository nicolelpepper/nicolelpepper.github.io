    "text": "The Thomas Fire, which ignited on December 4, 2017, burned approximately 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, making it one of the largest and most devastating wildfires in California’s history. The fire left behind extensive burn scars with widespread loss of vegetation and unstable soil, leaving the region vulnerable to erosion. In 2018, heavy rains caused massive flooding and debris flows, resulting in catastrophic damage and tragic loss of life.\nThis exercise will explore the impacts of the Thomas Fire using satellite imagery and air quality data.\nAbout the data:\n\nThe thomas_fire.shp is a shapefile containing the fire perimeter for the Thomas Fire in 2017. It is subset of a CAL FIRE dataset with historical boundaries for fires (including both natural and prescribed fires) in the state of California. The dataset has a good record of past large fires but is not complete and may be missing some fires. The thomas_fire.shp data is stored in /data/thomas_fire folder in the repo, I did not push the original full Cal Fire dataset to GitHub, it was accessed locally.\nThe landsat.nc dataset is an image from Landsat Collection 2 Level-2, from the Microsof Planetary Computer data catalogue. Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Science Products consist of atmospherically corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature image data.
