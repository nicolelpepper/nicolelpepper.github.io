I'm a data scientist with a focus on using spatial and diverse datasets to tackle pressing environmental challenges. Over the past six years, I have worked at the intersection of GIS, remote sensing, and environmental science—applying data-driven solutions to a range of environmental applications. 

I'm a Cartography Intern with the Woodwell Climate Research Center where I support the cartography team in developing maps and visualizing environmental data to communicate the impacts of climate change.

I spent the past two years as the Program and Communications Coordinator for NASA Acres, where I helped launch the program and coordinated a portfolio of national-scale research projects focused on advancing the use of satellite data to support U.S. agriculture and food security. Previously, I worked as a Geospatial Analyst for an environmental nonprofit in Northern Colorado, contributing to forest and riparian restoration efforts. Across all my professional roles, my focus has remained consistent: translating environmental data into meaningful action.

I'm based out of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. When I’m not making maps or wrangling data, I like to spend my time outdoors including backpacking, snowboarding, and mountain biking.
